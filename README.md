# open-advocacy
Open Advocacy is a collection of Open Source Advocacy tools/services, exciting part is all these are secure.  Advocacy is an essential part of societies and also Internet. In this era of data tracking, mass-surveillance and unethical attempts of monetization of advocacy platforms, this project will be a very needed resource to find free, accessible, open-source, privacy secured apps/services at one place.
