# Open Advocacy
Advocacy is a essential part of socities and so does Internet. In this era of data tracking, mass-surveillance and unethical attempts of monetization of advocacy platforms, we need services and platforms which doesn't collect our personal data.

Open Advocacy is a collection of open-source tools for activists, which includes the principles of

* freedom
* privacy
* federation
* decentralization
* accessibility

We want to ensure Corporations 
* can't make psychometric profiling of activists
* can't monetize the data generated from our movement
* can't adjust their flawed algorithms to suppress our voices
* can't alienate us from our supporters entirely

We are looking for developers, designers, user experience advocates, and allied organizations and campaigns to build open tools that push the field forward and are available to all.
